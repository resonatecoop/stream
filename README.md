Resonate is an open-source music streaming service run by a cooperative of artists and software developers.

If you want to know what we're building or want to get more involved, head over to the Platform category on our [forum](https://community.resonate.is/t/development-team/1724) or read the [Developer Guide](https://community.resonate.is/docs?topic=2262) in our [Resonate Handbook](https://community.resonate.is/docs).

If you're looking for a good first task, feel encouraged to take on an un-assigned ['help wanted' issues](https://github.com/resonatecoop/stream/issues).

Are you building something using the Resonate [API](#api) and would like to request a change? Resonate welcomes #proposals in the [Co-Operation section of the forum](https://community.resonate.is/c/66).

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

Quick-n-dirty instructions to get the player up and running on your computer using http and pointing to the existing production API (see [API](#api) to learn more about the API). 
Assumes the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

_Stuck? Make an issue on Github! Curious about the roadmap? Ask in the [forum](https://community.resonate.is/t/development-team/1724)_. 

Clone the repo and `cd` into it:

```sh
git@github.com:resonatecoop/stream.git
cd stream
```

Install [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm. 

```sh
npm i lerna -g
```

Install dependencies: 

```sh
lerna bootstrap
```

Create your env file:

```sh
cp beta/.env.example beta/.env
```

Run the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see the app running at http://localhost:8080.

Try logging in at http://localhost:8080/login.

You can run the app at a different port using the command below:

```sh
npm run dev -- --port 8089
```

The embed app (optional)

```sh
lerna run --scope embed start --parallel
```

### Testing on Mobile: Using HTTPS

HTTPS is required to test PWAs on mobile. [Read more about Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/install-criteria/). 

#### Nginx

You can find a reference [nginx configuration](/docs/nginx/beta.resonate.localhost.conf) file in the docs.
Note that the reference is not a complete `nginx.conf` file, it should fit within your existing configuration or be wrapped in a http block directive:

```
http {
  server {
  }
}
```

In the example `nginx.conf`, note the lines referring to the `ssl_certificate_key` and the `ssl_certificate_key`. 

#### Generating a Custom Certificate

You can generate a custom certificate using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for `beta.resonate.localhost`. *This origin is whitelisted in our CORS config*.

Generate the certificate (`cert.pem`) and key (`key.pem`) for `beta.resonate.localhost`:

```sh
mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem beta.resonate.localhost
```

In your nginx.conf file, update the `ssl_certificate_key` and the `ssl_certificate_key` to refer to your new key and certificate files. 

#### Update your Hosts file

Update your hosts file to include:

```
127.0.0.1       beta.resonate.localhost
```

#### Update on your .env file

```sh
APP_DOMAIN=beta.resonate.localhost
APP_HOST=https://beta.resonate.localhost
```

#### Run the app!

```sh
npm run dev
```
You should now see the player running on https://beta.resonate.localhost or 

## Development

### API

If you want to build on the API for personal use, consider checking the [backlog in our community forum](https://community.resonate.is/c/platform/52). 
The Tracks API repo is currently private, but you may ask for access in the forum. 

The Swagger API documentation is currently in flux and split across the [Resonate Search API](https://api.resonate.coop/v2/docs) (see the top right corner for the different services) and [Resonate Service Documentation: User](https://api.resonate.ninja/#/). 

### Other Commands

### Add a package

```sh
lerna add @resonate/button --scope "beta"
```

### Add a dev dependency

Here's how you would add gulp to tools

```sh
lerna add gulp --scope tools
```

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

To compile a specific package

```sh
lerna run build --scope "@resonate/rangeslider"
```

## Testing

Run all tests (standard, dependency-check)

```sh
npm test
```

Test a specific component

```sh
lerna run test --scope "@resonate/player-component"
```

A package can have browser tests (tape-run)

```sh
lerna run test:browser --scope "@resonate/api-factory-generator"
```

## Commands

Commands may be run with `$ lerna run`.

Example: `$ lerna run --scope beta start --parallel`.

Command                 | Description                                      |
------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
`$ npm run dev`         | Start beta app development server
`$ npm test`            | Lint, validate deps & run dependency-check for all packages
`$ npm run build`       | Compile all beta app files into `beta/dist/`

## Code style

We use [standard](https://standardjs.com/) as a linter and javascript style guide.
Make sure to add appropriate plugin for your editor (see: [standard#are-there-text-editor-plugins](https://github.com/standard/standard#are-there-text-editor-plugins)) or install a [pre-commit hook](https://standardjs.com/#use-a-pre-commit-hook) (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) to automatically apply the standard style.
