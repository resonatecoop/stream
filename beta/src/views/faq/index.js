        question: 'How does Stream2own work? How many Credits per play?',
        answer: `
          <p>Stream2own is Resonate's user-centric payment model. It lets you affordably explore new music while rewarding the artists you love -- without being interruped by transactions, advertisements, and paywalls. For each song, the price per play starts tiny and increases bit by bit, reflecting the unique relationship between each listener and the artists they listen to.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your purchase of a particular song is split over the first nine times you play it.</li>
            <li>The first time you play that song it is 0.002 Credits / 0.0024 EUR / 0.0029 USD.</li>
            <li>Each time you return to that song and play it, the price doubles.</li>
            <li>The ninth play is 0.512 Credits / 0.625 EUR / 0.76 USD.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After the ninth play of that song, you own it! You can stream that song for free on Resonate as much as you want. All songs you own will appear under the Collection tab inside your Library.
